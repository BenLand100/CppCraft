CppCraft is a rather ambitious project of mine to create either a MineCraft
bot or fully fledged client. At the very least, it is a real-time renderer
of a MineCraft world and is capable of connecting to a vanilla MineCraft 
server by emulating a vanilla client. Not all features are added, but the
world is navigable and many important blocks are rendered properly.

To build you will need OpenGL, zlib, SDL, and SDL_net development distributions. 
To test, you will need to grab a MineCraft server and turn authentication off 
(since the CppCraft does not yet negotiate authentication with MineCraft's 
servers). Feel free to turn gravity down, increase jump velocity, and jump
over mountains! Just be sure to enable flying on the server first. ;)
