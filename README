CppCraft is a rather ambitious project of mine to create either a minecraft
bot or fully fledged client. At the very least, it is a real-time renderer
of a minecraft world and is capable of connecting to a vanilia minecraft 
server by emulating a vanilia client. Not all features are added, but the
world is navigable and many important blocks are rendered properly.
