CppCraft is a rather ambitious project of mine to create either a MineCraft
bot or fully fledged client. At the very least, it is a real-time renderer
of a MineCraft world and is capable of connecting to a vanilla MineCraft 
server by emulating a vanilla client. Not all features are added, but the
world is navigable and many important blocks are rendered properly.

To build you will need an OpenGL development distribution, as well as 
headers for SDL and SDL_net. To test, you will need to grab a MineCraft
server and turn authentication off (since the CppCraft does not yet negotiate
authentication with MineCraft's servers)
